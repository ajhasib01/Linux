# Use git in LINUX

**STEPS:** 

- First create a folder where u want to use git

- Then initialize git by `git init`

- If u want to chck status then write `git status`

- Then make something eg. file and write anything then add it by `(git add {file name} or git add {.}`
        {.} for everything.

- If u want to commit something then use `git commit` If you using it for the first time  u need to make a repository in github and copy the url.


- To remotely access `git remote add url`

- Then for pushing the file to github `git push -u origin master` [It's not always master branch u can create your own branch and push to it just writing that branch name instead of master.]
then give username and for password you  need a token 
for token go to `developer section` on github and look for `personal access token` and from that section choose `fine-grained tokens` give usable permission and generate the key .
